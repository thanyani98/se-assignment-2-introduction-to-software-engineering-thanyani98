# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

 is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

 ref: https://www.mtu.edu/cs/undergraduate/software/what/#:~:text=Software%20engineering%20is%20the%20branch,software%20solutions%20for%20end%20users.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering involves more structured and organized software development process that includes requirements engineering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance on the other hand 
Traditional Programming refers to any manually created program that uses input data and runs on a computer to produce the output

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Phase 1: Planning
It involves defining the softwareâ€™s purpose and scope, much like          pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route

Phase 2: Requirements Analysis
It analysis, seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. 
 
Phase 3: Design
This phase is all about building the framework of the project

Phase 4: Coding
This phase is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code

Phase 5: Testing
We consider this phase as a stringent quality inspection on a production line

Phase 6: Deployment
The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.

Phase 7: Maintenance.
We  considers this phase as a long-term strategies, for instance, upgrading or replacing the software.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Waterfall Model: Is a step-by-step method where each stage must be finalized prior to the commencement of the subsequent one. 

Agile Methodology: This model focuses on flexibility and customer satisfaction by continuously delivering functional software components.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system

The importance of requirements Engineering in the software development life cycle is because Software requirements provide the basis for practical testing. By having a complete and well-documented set of requirements

ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering



Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

In software design, modularity refers to a logical partitioning of the software design that allows complex software to be manageable for the purpose of implementation and maintenance.
It make your code more organized, reusable, and maintainable

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Unit tests
Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application

Integration tests
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together

system testing
focus on the business requirements of an application

Acceptance testing
Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control systems is the process of tracking and managing changes to software code.
Version control system is important because they lead to significant of improving code quality. 
Git is the example of Version control system because it Tracks history

ref: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control#:~:text=Version%20control%2C%20also%20known%20as,to%20source%20code%20over%20time.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A software project manager is a person who leads the project team, which consists of developers, analysts, testers, graphic designers, and technical writers. 
The key responsibility of a project manager are Plan and develop the project idea, Create and lead the team.
Challenges faced in managing software projects?
Poor planning
Resource allocation
Scope creep
Budget

ref: Wrike

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with what your customer needs
Four types of maintenance which are Corrective,Adaptive,Predictive ,Preventive
The maintenance phase in the software development process is where the software is monitored to ensure it continues to function as it was designed to, and repairs or upgrades are performed as needeed and also every software need maintenace in order to fuction properly

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
